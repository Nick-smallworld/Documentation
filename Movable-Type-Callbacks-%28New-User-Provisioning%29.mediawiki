= New User Provisioning =

* new_user_provisioning

This callback relates to the auto-creation of blogs when new authors are created.  Note that this plugin is *only* triggered when the config directive NewUserAutoProvisioning and/or the system setting  "Automatically create a new blog for each new user".  As such, this callback is not suitable for performing arbitrary functions when any author gets created.  While it is called "new_user_provisioning", it deals more specifically with "new user *blog* provisioning.

There is one core new_user_provisioning callback registered, which auto-creates blogs for new users when the above settings are enabled.
