Say you wanted to create a new translation in Chinese.

The steps for the creation of a translation file are this:

1. Goto MT_ROOT

2. Edit a new file called lib/MT/L10N/cn.pm

3. Copy this code:

<pre><nowiki>
---
# Movable Type (r) Open Source (C) 2001-2007 Six Apart, Ltd.
# This program is distributed under the terms of the
# GNU General Public License, version 2.

package MT::L10N::cn;
use strict;
use MT::L10N;
use MT::L10N::en_us;
use vars qw( @ISA %Lexicon );
@ISA = qw( MT::L10N::en_us );

## The following is the translation table.

%Lexicon = (


);

1;
---
</nowiki></pre>

4. Execute build/make-l10n cn

5. The file is placed in /tmp/cn.pm

Now the file will contain an hash of strings. The keys of the hash are the original English strings. Their value must be the translations. There are special strings, "_UPPER_CASE_STRINGS", whose original values must be checked in en_US.pm in order to be translated, i.e.: '_USER_DISABLE' => 'Disable',
