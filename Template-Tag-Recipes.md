This is the Movable Type Template Tag Cookbook. Each of the recipes below can help users achieve specific effects with their Movable Type templates.

Effectively using Movable Type's template tag system can be both easy and daunting. Figuring out just the right combination of tags to do just what you want isn't always easy or obvious. I hope this cookbook and its recipes can help everybody now and again!
