<sup>1</sup> - ''You will see "SSIA" used most frequently as the only text entered in the body of a bug report.  Unfortunately, it's demonstrably false and demonstrates nothing more than the writer's laziness and a lack of respect for other people's time.  When filing a bug, you should '''always''' assume that the reader will have no clue what you're talking about.  The more information, screenshots and links you include in a case, the less work the reader will have to do to understand what the case is about.''
