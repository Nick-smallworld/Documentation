== Overview ==

Anyone, and I mean ''anyone'' can make a contribution to Movable Type. All you need is an idea and a computer, which by virtue of reading this document you already have. But how do you take an idea and turn into a product reality? What is the process? Who is involved? Is bribery involved? What if I can't code?

Those are just some of the question people wanting to contribute ask themselves. The following documentation aims to answer these questions by outlining a process by which anyone with an idea can contribute to Movable Type.
