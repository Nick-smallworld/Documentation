== Abstract ==

Frequently tags are deprecated, but users are never informed when they are using such a tag. To help people use the proper and intended tags, we need someway to identify what those tags are.

== Problems ==

* there is no feedback to the developer/admin that deprecated tags are in use

== Proposal ==

'''Additions to Registry'''

I propose we augment the tags registry to support the following syntax:

    tags:
        function: 
            tagname:
                handler: $Example::Example::Plugin::tagname
                deprecated: "This tag has been deprecated in favor of tagfoo."

The absence of a deprecated tag means the tag is kosher.

'''Messaging in Edit Template UI'''

Finally, when a user edits a template that contains a tag that is deprecated, a warning message should appear for each deprecated tag that is in use. The message that appears should be what is registered for that tag in the tag's 'deprecated' registry property.

== Open Issues ==

* Should these messages only appear when DebugMode is enabled?
** No.
