Actually, this can be used to apply text filters to anything. In my Entry Summary and Entry Detail templates, I originally had this:

 &lt;h1><a href="<$MTEntryPermalink$>"><mt:entrytitle></a></h1>

Which works fine, but what I really wanted was to apply Smartypants to get proper punctuation. So I came up with this:

 <mt:setvarblock name="markdown_title"># <a href="<$MTEntryPermalink$>"><mt:entrytitle></a></mt:setvarblock>
 <mt:getvar name="markdown_title" filters="markdown_with_smartypants">

Which does exactly what I want. It also means I could do things like add asterisks around words in a title to make them bold or italic.
